# Setup Guide

Welcome to my interactive app!

#  I've chosen to use Expo for this project because it`s faster to set up and start coding


## Node and NPM Installation

Our project requires Node.js (version > 18) and NPM. If you don't have Node.js installed, you can install it using the following steps:

1. Install Node.js and NPM following the official installation guide for your operating system.
2. Alternatively, you can use Node Version Manager (NVM) for Node.js installation.

## Getting Started
